# Sample MP3 Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the sample MP3 file.

To add a real MP3 file:
1. Replace this file with an actual MP3 audio file
2. Name it `sample.mp3`
3. Recommended: Use a short instrumental track or ambient music
4. Keep file size under 5MB for better loading performance

For development, you can use any royalty-free music or create a simple audio file.

Example sources for royalty-free music:
- Freesound.org
- YouTube Audio Library
- Pixabay Music
- Incompetech.com

Note: The music widget will work without this file, but won't play audio.
